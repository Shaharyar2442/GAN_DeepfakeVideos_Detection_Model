Step 1-
git clone repository

Step 2-
Create two new folders in parent directory(GAN_DEEPFAKEVIDEOS_DETECTION_MODEL) named checkpoints and logs

Step 3
Download the dataset from google drive, you can put the dataset folder in the parent directory(GAN_DEEPFAKEVIDEOS_DETECTION_MODEL) aswell

Step 4
Create virtual environment with the following commands in terminal:
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
After these two commands in terminal you will see (venv) before the C:path

Step 5
Once inside virtual environment run the command : pip install -r requirements.txt 
Also Install pytorch from official site: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ . 
Here you will have to check the PC for which Cuda version it has, then accordingly download correct option from website

Step 6
Once environment and packages all set up go to training/train.py and on line 17 set DATA_ROOT = r""  # Added the path of Processed_FakeAVCeleb here

After this you can run python training/train.py to start training
